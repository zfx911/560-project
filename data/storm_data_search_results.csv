In Alexandria (Fairfax/Arlington Co), water rose to 5 feet deep in the Old Town district, flooding numerous shopts, restaurants, and publs.  Fortunately, many shop owners had moved valuable merchandise to higher locations prior to the surge, minimizing property damage.

Farther south, the pounding waves and above normal tides caused damage to piers, marinas, and some residences in Prince William, Stafford, and King George Counties.  Along the tidal Potomac River, a storm surge of at least 6 feet piled up water in the Occoquan Bay, eventually flooding numerous homes in Occoquan and Woodbridge.  In Stafford Co, the surge caused substantial boat and pier damage near Aquia Creek, and a picnic area was flooded at Quantico.

Damage was fairly heavy along the immediate shore of the Chesapeake Bay and tidal Potomac River in Charles, St Mary's, Calvert, and Anne Arundel Counties.  In Charles Co, property damage was estimated at $1.6 million with Cobb Island suffering substantial losses.  Approximately 75 homes were flooded; between 100 and 200 piers and bulkheads were damaged or destroyed.  Affected Charles Co residents believed this to be a flood of memory rivaling that of Hurricane Hazel in 1954.  Substantial damage was also noted at newly developed land along the shore in northern Calvert and southern Anne Arundel Counties (North Beach/Chesapeake Beach).  In all, $1.4 million in damage was incurred in Anne Arundel Co, including 83 homes, 7 commercial properties, and a total of 100 bulkheads and piers.  Twenty homes were flooded along the northern Calvert Co shoreline.  Farther north, in southeastern Baltimore Co, 100 people were evacuated in the Bowley's Quarter area.

Damage was notable but substantially less in St Mary's Co where coastal residential and business development lags.",8

Most of the damage which resulted from Hurricane Georges was caused by the storm surge.","Spiral bands associated with Hurricane Georges moved north over south Florida on the evening of Thursday September 24 1998. The convective activity embedded in the spiral bands was moving to the southwest near 45 knots. Hurricane Georges moved off the coast of central Cuba on the morning of Friday September 25 1998. Georges moved northwest over the Straits of Florida. The eye passed over Key West at mile marker 1 of US-1 between 1100 AM EST and 1230 PM EST.  The greastest damage from wind and storm surge flooding occurred in the lower Keys from Cudjoe Key, mile marker 21, to Big Pine Key, mile marker 31. NWS personnel estimated 105-110 knot wind gusts from the south and southeast in this area with sustained winds near 90 knots.  As the north side of the eye wall passed over Key West, the highest sustained winds were 58 knots with gusts to 76 knots from the east and northeast. The Key West ASOS lost power at that time. Georges continued to move northwest over the Gulf of Mexico. The southwest coast of Florida experienced widespread beach erosion from the storm surge.",95

A moderate 974mb low curved northeast to its position just south of Shemya at 3am Thursday.  The front ahead of the low was preceded by brisk east to southeast winds.  Brisk southeast winds spread northeast across the Bering, reaching the Pribilofs Thursday evening.  Southeast winds also began to increase along the Alaska Peninsula, eastern Aleutians and southwest Alaska between 6pm and midnight Thursday.  The winds were accompanied by brief periods of heavy snow and driving rain.  Brief blizzard conditions were reported locally along the southwest Alaskan coast.
     By 3 am Friday, a rapidly intensifying 957mb low, which had been racing northeastward close to 50 mph, pulled up just west of Adak, in the central Aleutians, with its front arcing east and south to Umnak Island (western Fox Islands) then south southwest into the north Pacific.  This front was preceded by strong southerly winds.  Strong winds were also reported up to 360 miles across the south and southeast quadrants of the center.  Strong low level west to northwest winds were evident from satellite pictures, in data void areas, near Amchitka. At the same time, very cold arctic air covered nearly the entire mainland and even Southeast Alaska.  The arctic front at 3am Friday extended from Nunivak Island to about 60 miles south of King Salmon to Afognak Island and Middleton Island before dipping southeast into the Panhandle of the State.  90 degree temperature contrasts were seen in  3 am surface data plots for the Alaska Region prepared early morning surface map...ranging from a frigid  45 below at Northway (in the arctic air) to a relatively balmy 45 above at Dutch Harbor (in the polar airmass).  These reporting stations are separated by a little more than 1500 miles.  Brisk east to southeast winds, on the cold side of the arctic front, had spread into the Seward Peninsula and southwest mainland of the State. 
     The low peaked close to 950 mbs in intensity  while continuing north northeast to a position about 60 miles northwest of Nunivak Island just prior to midnight Friday.  The frontal system associated with the storm, by this time, stretched  in an arc through Savoonga  to the northern tip of Norton Bay then south southeast through Iliamna to 300 miles south of Sand Point.  Strong southerly prefrontal winds spread through the southwestern 2/3rds of the Alaska mainland.... while strong easterly winds on the cold side of the arctic front had spread across all but the northeastern 1/3rd of the mainland.   Strong winds (in excess of 60 mph) were also reported around the low greater than about 240 miles from the storm center over the southern semicircle.
     By 3am Saturday, the storm was located near Hooper Bay, along the southwest Alaska coast, with its front arcing through Kotzebue Sound to Upper Cook Inlet then south and southwest into the Pacific.  The arctic front at this time extended from the Queen Charlotte Islands of Canada to about 60 miles south of Yakutat, through northwest Prince William Sound, and into the northern Seward Peninsula.
     At 3pm Saturday, the low had split into two, weakening 972 mb centers.  The original began to weaken rapidly near Elim.  The second center was located just north of the Red Dog Mine in northwest Alaska, with the front, aloft over the arctic airmass, arcing near Prudhoe Bay to Fairbanks to Glennallen to Cape Saint Elias then south and southwest into the north Pacific.  The arctic front had weakened considerably, extending from Hecate Strait to Cape Yakataga to just south of Mount McKinley to near Huslia to the original low near Elim then southwest into the Bering Sea.  By this time, much of the strong southeasterly wind in advance of the polar and arctic fronts had diminished.

SAR:  F/V NOWITNA - TAKING ON WATER, 70NM W OF COLD BAY (later reported vessel sank)
SITUATION:  22/0412 local time -  The vessel's initial distress stated they were taking on water, donning survival suits, and were preparing to abandon ship.  An HH-60 helo from Kodiak, pre-staged in St Paul for Operation Northern Safeguard, launched and the CGC Mellon, 100nm away,  diverted to scene but were unable to launch their HH-65 due to heavy weather and sea state. An HC-130 was also launched from Kodiak to provide cover and de-watering pumps if needed.  The F/V Dona Martita tried to assist but the 20ft seas and 45kt winds prevented any attempts at rescue.  The HH-60 arrived on scene and finding the vessel's deck awash elected to hoist the crew immediately rather than deploy pumps and attempt to de-water the vessel.  After a successful hoist evolution all 6 crewman were safely transported to Cold Bay in good condition.  The post rescue plan is to attempt to relocate the vessel tomorrow and provide a position for a commercial salvage operation if the vessel afloat.  222235V case closed.  Wx: wind SE 45kts, seas 20ft.  6 lives saved.

SAR:  MEDEVAC 49YOM F/V ENDURANCE, 70NM NW OF COLD BAY
SITUATION:  22/0904 local time -  The patient was suffering from acute appendicitis and the Flight Surgeon recommend immediate medevac.  Despite heavy seas near helo launch limits, the CGC Mellon managed to launch their HH-65 helo.  The patient was flown to Cold Bay and was transferred to Lifeflight for further transport to Anchorage.  2221200V case closed. Wx: Wind S 50kts, Seas 20ft. 1 life saved.

SAR:  MEDEVAC 30YOM F/V KODIAK ENTERPRISE, 75NM W OF COLD BAY
SITUATION:  22/1330 local time -  A wave broke over the deck of the vessel and knocked the crewman and assorted gear into the hold of the vessel.  The crewman was knocked unconscious and rescued by the crew.  The crewman wasn't breathing and had no pulse.  The EMT onboard administered CPR for six minutes and revived the patient.  The HH-65 helo departed Cold Bay, after completing NPSC 0205, and hoisted the patient and transported him to Cold Bay.  An awaiting Lifeflight Learjet transported the patient from Cold Bay to Anchorage. 221845V case closed.  Wx: Winds S 75kts, Seas 25-30ft, Vis 5nm. 1 life saved.

SAR:  MEDICO 29YOM F/V NORSEMAN, 64NM SE OF ST PAUL
SITUATION:  23/0413 local time -  24hrs earlier, a rough wave broke over the 120ft F/V Norseman's deck and knocked the 29YOM crewman into a crab pot.  The crab pot's bars hit the crewman across the lower part of his chest and he was experiencing severe chest and left arm pains.  The pain was mild as long as the crewman remained still.  The duty CG Flight Surgeon recommended 24hrs of bed-rest and apply a cold compress to crewman's affected areas.  F/V Norseman was placed on a 4hr commsked while they safely transited to Dutch Harbor.  240100V  Case closed.

     Across east Anchorage, particularly along the hillside, damage reports received so far indicate minor property damage.  Along the Glen Highway, a camper was blown off the road in front of an Alaska Region employee Friday.  Downed trees caused several power outages and structural damage to adjacent houses/buildings in their fall paths.  Several satellite dishes were sent into other parts of town.  A report from a resident at about Huffman and Hillside Drive (beginning of the Upper Anchorage Hillside) reported that the strong wind destroyed two of his large antenna systems...one of which was a 12 foot diameter solid fiberglass dish and the other an array of 12 yagi antennas (which he says he used for Earth-Moon-Earth communications?).  The yagis did not present a large wind load.
     Blizzard conditions, followed by areas of freezing rain, plagued the southwest coast as the storm hit.  Coastal flooding and movement of pack ice toward shore also caused local problems along the southwest coast of the State.  Up to 4 feet of coastal storm surge water was reported over the ice near Bethel along the Kuskokwim River.
     The forecast of impending hazardous weather prompted the cancellation of the Kuskokwim 500 dog race normally held at this time of year.  As a matter of fact, race officials commented on how strange it was to cancel the race...when skies were so clear and conditions so favourable the day before the storm hit.  A Kwethluk man died when his snowmachine went into the overflow.  Two others with him managed to climb to safety.
     Snowfall across much of Southcentral Alaska and the Kuskokwim Valley...still in the arctic air and in advance of the front associated with the storm...ranged from 9 inches to locally close to 3 feet in about a 24 hour period.

The strongest storm, a supercell, passed through Calvert County and spawned an F1 tornado about 1 mile southeast of Dunkirk.  The tornado had a width of 75 yards, traveled on the ground for 1 1/2 miles and was responsible for over $200,000 worth of damage.  The first building struck by the twister around 3:40 PM EDT was a private school under construction on Mt. Harmony Road about 1/2 mile east of Route 4. The tornado damaged 3 sections of an 8 to 10 ton reinforced brick wall and removed a 30 foot section of roof. Two windows on cars in a nearby parking lot were blown out.  An old wooden barn about 600 yards from the school was also destroyed. The tornado moved east-northeast for about a mile, damaging trees and causing minor home damage along its path as it crossed through Cattertons Reach and Megatha Lane.  The tornado dissipated near the intersection of Chesapeake Road West and Route 2 (Solomons Island Road) at 3:45 PM EDT.  In addition to the tornado damage, a barn filled with farm equipment across from Mt. Harmony Elementary School near Dunkirk was destroyed by downburst winds.  Also, Mid Bay buoy east of St. Leonard recorded a wind gust near 90 knots around 4:00 PM EDT as the same storm moved across the Chesapeake Bay.  

Before the supercell became tornadic near Dunkirk, it passed through northern Charles County.  Winds in excess of 55 MPH produced over $50,000 worth of damage. At the intersection of Bensville Road and Courtney Drive west of Waldorf, straight line winds destroyed a two story home under construction around 3:05 PM. Quarter sized hail was reported and ten trees within one half mile of the home were also damaged. Quarter sized hail also fell in White Plains and Waldorf.  A resident of St. Charles reported a funnel cloud at the intersection of St. Charles Parkway and Smallwood Drive at 3:07 PM EDT. 

Additional thunderstorms moved across Central Maryland between 2 and 7 PM EDT.  In Prince George's County, a postal worker in Clinton was injured around 3:15 PM EDT when lightning struck near her.  Pea sized hail was reported in Accokeek and Clinton.  A motorist near College Park reported seeing a funnel cloud around 4:45 PM EDT. Nickel sized hail fell in Rosaryville. In Charles County, quarter sized hail fell in Lynnbrook around 6:00 PM EDT. Quarter sized hail was also reported in extreme northwest Calvert County around 6:15 PM EDT. 

In Montgomery County, quarter sized hail fell in Germantown, Rockville, and Wheaton.  Dime sized hail fell in Layhill and Colesville, and half dollar sized hail fell in Gaithersburg.  The volume of hail resulted in accumulations of 3 to 4 inches on lawns and roadways, with drifts up to 10 inches against buildings and fences.  Trees were stripped of leaves, small dents were found on cars, and one neighborhood in Gaithersburg reported chipped paint on homes.  In Howard County, golf ball sized hail fell in Columbia.  In Baltimore County, pea sized hail was reported in Brookland at 5:43 PM EDT.  In Washington County, quarter sized hail fell on the north side of Hagerstown and minor stream flooding was reported after heavy downpours in Hancock. 

Heavy rain and strong east winds over the Chesapeake Bay also led to tidal flooding in Annapolis Harbor on the morning of the 21st.  Several roads near the City Dock area were flooded with up to 2 feet of water around high tide.  Water poured over the seawall forcing police to barricade Dock Street and to close Compromise Street.

The low then moved into the southeast Bering Sea early Monday, finally weakening to a 967 mb center just south of Saint Lawrence Island early Tuesday.  Strong southwesterly winds were observed along the back side of the easily 'hurricane force' storm.   Gusts of 76 mph were recorded at both Adak and Atka on the back side of this storm Sunday.

The front associated with the storm was preceded by very strong south and southeast winds across the Aleutians, the Pribilofs and the Alaska Peninsula Sunday.  The front moved to a position from Nunivak Island to just southwest of Chignik late Sunday.  By 3 pm Monday, the front had weakened...extending in a broad arc from Norton Sound to near Homer...but still preceded by strong southeast winds in exposed areas.  By early Tuesday, the front no longer posed a wind threat , extending from the Alcan border of the State into the eastern Gulf of Alaska.

Initially, the front was also accompanied by heavy rains.  Even by Alaskan standards, these rains were impressive, leaving close to 4 inches around Cold Bay in a 24 hour period.  Classic urban drainage and small stream flooding was reported in this tiny western Alaska Peninsula community of less than 100 people.

Pictures taken for the Anchorage Daily News showed pumps at work in the Dutch Harbor/Unalaska area.  Heavy rains there left high water in low lying places of this normally 'very weather savvy' Aleutian community.  Late reports from the Dutch Harbor Fisherman, also revealed that the Pyramid Creek bridge, which spans Captain's Bay Road, was washed away when heavy rains brought floodwaters to the area.  The '...washout was violent and almost instantaneous' said Dave Kemp, the public works director.  At 8:10 am Friday, Kemp received a call that Pyrmaid Creek was nearing flood stage.  When he arrived at the scene at 8:17 am, the bridge had been deposited into Captain's Bay.  In addition to halting the ability to move container trucks into Unalaska, power was interrupted at Crowley Marine Services.  


Southerly winds just ahead of the front peaked at 122 mph at the Dutch Harbor Spit (as recorded on the 5:30 am Sunday observation).  Along the Alaska Peninsula, although peak winds only reached 67 mph at the Cold Bay ASOS.  Stronger winds, gusting around 100 mph, at King Cove produced considerable damage and several injuries due to flying debris.  Peak winds around Bristol Bay locally reached as high as 63 mph.
   
Wind gusts were channeled by terrain in the Matanuska Valley, where easterly gusts reached 73 mph at the Wasilla Fire Station Monday ahead of the front.  Gusts at the Portage ASOS reached 80 mph around noon Monday.  Prefrontal winds at the Prince William Sound Science Center reached 62 mph late Monday.  Winds at the abandoned old Nike missile site near the Alpenglow Ski area (3900+ ft asl) gusted as high as 128 mph at 6pm Monday, diminishing rapidly with frontal passage just prior to 11 pm. 

Across the Pribilofs, pre-frontal winds reached 60 mph just after 10 am Sunday.  Strongest winds, however, were on the back side of the low with gusts peaking at 71 mph in the early afternoon.  Winds diminished below 60 mph by 7pm Monday. 

Although wind gusts remained below 60 mph along the Kuskokwim Delta, a prolonged south and southwest fetch of strong winds brought high water to many coastal communities.  Coastal flooding  caused significant damage Monday to several locations.   The onset of this coastal flooding coincided with very high tides.

Storm Surge and Coastal Flood impacts: 
Zone 207: 
Shishmaref: The storm took out much more shoreline than past storms (since 1997). The village sits on a 5 to 8 foot high bluff which is being eroded by storms. One home was moved back as a result of the erosion from the storm reaching the structure. A road along the bluff was washed out for 100 ft or so...to just the size of a path; previously there had been a 10 foot buffer of ground from the bluff edge to the road. Some drying racks near the shore for subsistence fishing were taken out by the storm; value is unknown and the racks had little if any fish drying on them at the time. The storm created potential for more damage in the future: a Teacher housing unit is now becoming threatened.  A number of utility poles are becoming threatened.  Permafrost that the bluff (at the shore) sits on is now exposed, which will hasten it's melting, weakening the bluff edge. 
 
Kivalina: The village is located on a barrier island, with one side facing the ocean, and the other side facing a large lagoon. Oceanside damage: part of a drainfield was washed away and had to be repaired.  A teacher housing unit got hit by waves, and the windows were boarded up, and residents were evacuated temporarily, but no real damage occurred. About 5 feet of ground near the runway was lost, but didn't jeopardize the runway.  The storm did remove all previous sandbags. Lagoonside damage: The storm washed away about 500 feet of sandbag revetment along the shore. Honey Bucket Bunkers (where the contents of all the town's honey buckets are deposited) at the lagoon shore now have 3 sides exposed due to wave action from the storm.  Previously they had been buried in the ground with only the top 2 feet exposed.  This poses a health and safety concern for the villagers.

Seven miles south of Red Dog Port:  The Foss Maritime ore barge "Kivalina" was grounded by the wind and wave action, damaging several compartments.  No zinc ore was on board, and the 22,000 gallons of diesel fuel it was carrying remained intact. The barge's towline had parted in the storm from the tug.  This barge, along with another used to transport the zinc ore from Red Dog Mine, had been moved away from the Red Dog Port to ride out the storm at sea.

Zone 209: Kotzebue: Front Street had significant areas of washout; especially where there was no concrete revetment. The southernmost segment of the concrete revetment along the shore off Front Street got damaged; this may have been due to not enough quality material underneath the revetment. Ted Stevens Way (a gravel road) had some washout along the road edge next to a lagoon; it was repaired fairly quickly. No homes were damaged.

West winds of 40 to 60 mph caused seas of 10 feet in Kotzebue sound and up to 20 feet in the outer sound and Chukchi Sea. This frontal system moved southeast over the central interior on the morning of the 9th, and it brought snow with locally heavy amounts to the Fairbanks area; the State of Alaska Department of Transportation reported nearly one foot of snow at Haystack Mountain (Zone 222) and also at Eagle Summit, both on the Steese Highway (Zone 220).   

Storm Surge and Coastal Flood impacts: 
Zone 207: 
Shishmaref: The storm took out much more shoreline than past storms (since 1997). The village sits on a 5 to 8 foot high bluff which is being eroded by storms. One home was moved back as a result of the erosion from the storm reaching the structure. A road along the bluff was washed out for 100 ft or so...to just the size of a path; previously there had been a 10 foot buffer of ground from the bluff edge to the road. Some drying racks near the shore for subsistence fishing were taken out by the storm; value is unknown and the racks had little if any fish drying on them at the time. The storm created potential for more damage in the future: a Teacher housing unit is now becoming threatened.  A number of utility poles are becoming threatened.  Permafrost that the bluff (at the shore) sits on is now exposed, which will hasten it's melting, weakening the bluff edge. 
 
Kivalina: The village is located on a barrier island, with one side facing the ocean, and the other side facing a large lagoon.

As much as 1 to 2 feet of snow fell over a large area, from the east slopes of the Berkshires across Worcester County and into the Merrimack Valley and North Shore communities.  Amounts tapered off dramatically from Boston to the South Shore, where only an inch or two of accumulation was reported before the snow changed to rain.  Aside from scattered power outages and dozens of minor accidents,
the heavy snow had little significant impact on the state, as most residents chose not to travel.  

Official storm totals include 14.0 inches at Worcester Airport, 5.0 inches at Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, 0.4 inch at Logan International Airport in Boston, and 0.2 inch at the National Weather Service office in Taunton.  Other snowfall totals as reported by trained spotters include 24 inches in Chesterfield and Worthington; 21 inches in Ashfield; 17 inches in Goshen and Greenfield; 16 inches in Tolland, Townsend, and Haverhill; 12 inches in Westfield, North Amherst, Sterling, Shrewsbury, Hopkinton, Billerica, and Bradford; 10 inches in Whately, Wilbraham, Hopedale, Framingham, and Andover; and 8 inches in Douglas and Reading.

The more significant impact of this storm was widespread coastal flooding.  A high astronomical tide combined with 15-foot seas to cause flooding along most of the eastern Massachusetts coastline.  In Marblehead, the downtown area was closed off after being flooded, and waves swept over the road to Marblehead Neck, shutting it down.  The storm surge also shut down sections of Route 129, throwing mud, rock, and a section of boardwalk across the road.  In Swampscott, a 60-foot section of sea wall along Blodgett Avenue collapsed, forcing the evacuation of several homes.  The Nahant Causeway was closed for almost four hours due to flooding, cutting off access to the peninsula.  Damage was most severe in Winthrop.  Waves crashed over the sea wall protecting Point Shirley during the midday high tide, inundating streets with up to 5 feet of water and flooding scores of cars and basements.  In all, about 50 homes were flooded.  In Scituate, another hard hit area, about 40 houses along Turner Road were left without power.  Residents estimated that 8 to 10 feet of water flooded Seventh Avenue, requiring evacuation.  In Humarock, a narrow strip of land in Scituate that often gets the worst of coastal storms, residents used front-end loaders and backhoes to clear mud and rocks from Central Avenue.

In Marshfield, several feet of water flooded roads in Brant Rock and police blocked off Hewitt's Point and the esplanade for several hours.

One person in Middlesex County was directly killed after a canopy full of snow collapsed on him. Snow slowly spread from south to north from around sunrise on Sunday the 16th in Cumberland and Cape May Counties to into the evening in Sussex County on the 16th. The heaviest snow fell during the daylight hours of the 16th in the southern half of the state and during the first half of the 17th in the northern half of the state. Heavy snow continued into the afternoon of the 17th in Sussex County. Precipitation started mixing with and changing to sleet across the southern half of the state during the late evening on the 16th and continued into the morning of the 17th. Precipitation changed to freezing rain and some plain rain along the immediate coast in Cape May and Atlantic Counties. Precipitation changed back to snow before it ended during the day on the 17th. In the northern half of the state, snow ended during the afternoon and evening of the 17th. Governor James McGreevey declared a state of emergency at 130 p.m. EST on the 16th. The State of Emergency gave the state police the authority to close highways and redirect traffic. It was cancelled at Noon EST on the 18th. Many municipalities declared their own snow emergencies giving police the authority to tow away vehicles parked on snow emergency routes. Volunteers, police and members of the office of emergency management helped transport medical personnel and dialysis patients to and from hospitals. Plows were dispatched with ambulances. Through the 18th, many elective surgical procedures were cancelled. All South Jersey bus service was suspended after 8 p.m. EST on the 16th. It was suspended statewide on the 17th. Service started again on the 18th with up to 40 minute delays. All South Jersey malls closed early on the 16th. Malls, businesses, universities, schools and shopping centers were closed on the 17th which was a federal holiday - President's Day. Businesses and universities started to reopen on the 18th. Morning traffic on the 16th was heavy in southern New Jersey as many shoppers made last minute preparations for the storm. There were no snow throwers or salt to be found. The plows managed to keep one lane of traffic open throughout the event on the Atlantic City Expressway and New Jersey Turnpike. All major roads were passable on the 17th. It cost state and local officials 14 million dollars to clear roadways. Most businesses reopened on the 18th, but schools and state courthouses remained closed. Organizers had to cancel or postpone meetings and events. Life returned closer to normal on Wednesday the 19th. That was also the first day of regular weekly train service. Strong winds caused about 11,000 homes and businesses to lose power along coastal New Jersey on the 17th. Power was restored by 6 p.m. EST that evening in Atlantic and Cape May Counties, but took until the 19th in Ocean and Monmouth Counties. The worst damage from the storm inland was caused by the weight of the snow and sleet which caused numerous roof collapses and collapses of "Florida rooms". Moderate tidal flooding and moderate to locally severe beach erosion affected coastal communities. Service on the Cape May/Lewes Ferry was suspended from the afternoon of the 16th through the morning of the 18th. 

In Sussex County, one senior citizen died of a heart attack while shoveling snow. There were several other reported cardiac conditions caused by shoveling the snow. Road crews, which worked up to 36 straight hours had problems with drifts that reached up to five feet. A broken water main in Newton was complicated by the snow on the 18th. In Middlesex County, a 23-year-old man was killed in Edison when a corrugated roof collapsed on him at the Edison Job Corps Academy. Eight of his classmates were injured (broken bones). They were walking into the academy's cafeteria when it collapsed. He died of asphyxiation. A practice field bubble collapsed at Rutgers University. The university did not reopen until the 19th. Schools in the county did not reopen until the 21st. In Metuchen, a large section of a roof of an unoccupied warehouse building collapsed. It took until the 19th for road crews to clear the back streets. In Monmouth County, drifts reached six feet. In Wall Township, a high school roof collapsed on the 18th because of four foot drifts at one corner of the roof. The roof collapse impaired the building's fire alarm system, compromised the old roof above the school's cafeteria and fell onto electrical wires between the roofs. The school was already closed for the week, but was able to reopen the following week. A country store was badly damaged in Freehold. In Ocean County, about 115 Florida rooms collapsed in and around Berkeley and Manchester Townships in three separate developments. One health care worker was injured. Car port roofs were also collapsing. Drifts reached up to 7 feet in the county. It took until the 20th for some side streets to be plowed. Thousands were snowbound for a week. Schools were closed for the week. The heavy snow caved in the roof of a landmark bowling alley in Point Pleasant. The roof of a Wal-Mart in Stafford Township collapsed. A 150 by 100 foot section collapsed. There were no injuries. In Burlington County, hundreds of residents were forced to leave their Tricia Meadows homes in Mount Laurel on the 17th after drifting snow blocked the roof top furnace flue and vent pipes. Carbon monoxide was building within their homes. A shelter was opened at a nearby school. Volunteers helped clear the roofs and residents returned that evening. The roof of an apparel printing business in Lumberton collapsed. Planes were grounded at McGuire Air Force Base through the 18th. In Atlantic County, the roof parapet of the Egg Harbor Township Middle School collapsed. It caused cracks and strain in the supports of the school's gym and auditorium. Flights at the Atlantic City International Airport resumed on the 18th after being halted on the 16th. Bus transportation in and out of Atlantic City was suspended on the 16th and restored on the 18th. Schools did not reopen until the 20th. Many business awnings collapsed because of the weight of the snow and sleet. In Camden County, demolition crews had to raze PJ's Saloon in Gloucester Township after the building sustained structural damage from its snow load. In Collingswood, roof leaks caused a ceiling collapse in one home. In Gloucester County, several barn collapses occurred. Cows and horses were rescued and were unharmed. In Monroe Township, an elderly man was critically injured when his snow covered car port collapsed. He suffered hypothermia. The Philadelphia Flyer wives had to cancel their carnival. In Cumberland County, there were a couple of building collapses in Vineland. A multi-car garage collapsed against an apartment building. Five people were evacuated when the apartment was declared unsafe. The roof of one and the awning of another mobile home collapsed. 

The combination of the high pressure system to the north and the low pressure system off the Virginia Coast produced some of the strongest onshore winds and highest tides of the winter season, especially for the southern half of the state.

This locked very cold air in place, slowed the low pressure system down and prevented it from going farther north thus leaving New Jersey on the snowier side of the system. Warm air did move in aloft between 5,000 and 10,000 feet and was the reason the snow changed to sleet during the evening and overnight on the 16th in the southern half of the state.",224

This locked very cold air in place, slowed the low pressure system down and prevented it from going farther north thus leaving New Jersey on the snowier side of the system. Warm air did move in aloft between 5,000 and 10,000 feet and was the reason the snow changed to sleet during the evening and overnight on the 16th in the southern half of the state.",227

At one time in its life cycle, it was a powerful Category 5 hurricane when it was north of the Leewood Islands. Isabel's track took it west of Chesapeake Bay and was able to funnel water into the bay. This caused flooding along coastal areas all the way into New Castle County. Rivers and streams in New Castle County flooded from two fronts: from the heavy rain inland and also from the storm surge. The tide at Reedy Point reached 8.66 feet above mean lower low water at 506 a.m. EDT on the 19th. The surge was about 5 feet. The surge funneled up the bay and was lower and occurred earlier close to the coast. The highest tide at Lewes (Sussex County) was 6.51 feet above mean lower low water at 324 p.m. EDT on the 18th. The heavy rain did not coincide with the tidal flooding and occurred mainly from the afternoon of the 18th into the early morning of the 19th. Nevertheless, runoff from streams in New Castle County were slowed because of the incoming storm surge. While tides barely reached minor tidal levels along the ocean, the wave action on top of the tide caused beach erosion. Dunes were breached on the ocean front south of South Bethany and water overwashed onto Delaware State Route 1 in several locations. Winds gusted up to 70 mph and caused numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines to be knocked down. This was one of the worst power outage events in history for Conectiv Energy.

At one time in its life cycle, it was a powerful Category 5 hurricane when it was north of the Leewood Islands. Isabel's track took it west of the bay and was able to funnel water into the bay. This caused flooding along coastal areas into Cecil County. A record breaking high tide of 7.91 feet above mean lower low water was observed at Tolchester Beach (Kent County). The surge was 6.88 feet. Tidal flooding problems began after Midnight EDT on the 19th and continued throughout the day on the 19th. The surge was so strong that it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Evacuations occurred near the bay. For example, in Kent County emergency management officials evacuated residents along Eastern Neck Road (State Route 455) from Rock Hall to the Eastern Neck Island. Tidal flooding occurred in and around Rock Hall, Chestertown, Skinners Neck, Piney Neck and Cliffs City. Tidal flooding carried inland on the Chester River to Chestertown. Over 100 homes, vehicles and boats were damaged and/or ruined. In addition, eleven marinas, three restaurants, two hotels, two Bed and Breakfast facilities, one boat building business and one marine railway reported major damage. In Queen Anne's County, public and private damage was estimated at 37 million dollars. Thirty-seven homes were destroyed, 151 suffered major damage and 192 suffered minor damage. Most of the damage was caused by the tidal flooding, although four homes were damaged by fallen trees. 

The heavy rain did not coincide with the tidal flooding and occurred mainly from the afternoon of the 18th into the early morning of the 19th. There were no reports of stream related flooding due to the heavy rain. Because the heaviest rain with tropical systems often falls west of its storm track, the region was spared heavier rain. On the other hand, the strongest winds are often on the right side of the storm track. Winds gusted up to 58 mph in the bay and caused numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines to be knocked down. This was one of the worst power outage events in history for Conectiv Energy. About 65,750 homes and businesses lost power with half of the outages in Cecil County. Overall about 148,000 of the 187,000 of Conectiv Energy's customers lost power. About three-quarters of the power was restored by the 20th and the rest of the 25th.

Peak wind gusts included 58 mph in Cambridge (Dorchester County), 55 mph at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport and 44 mph in Tolchester Beach. Storm totals included 3.40 inches in Federalsburg (Caroline County), 3.13 inches in Denton (Caroline County), 2.97 inches in Saint Michaels (Talbot County), 2.14 inches in Stevensville (Queen Anne's County) and 2.03 inches at the Conowingo Dam (Cecil County).",301

At one time in its life cycle, it was a powerful Category 5 hurricane when it was north of the Leewood Islands. Isabel's track took it west of the bay and was able to funnel water into the bay. This caused flooding along coastal areas into Cecil County. A record breaking high tide of 7.91 feet above mean lower low water was observed at Tolchester Beach (Kent County).

The surge was so strong that it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Evacuations occurred near the bay. For example, in Kent County emergency management officials evacuated residents along Eastern Neck Road (State Route 455) from Rock Hall to the Eastern Neck Island. Tidal flooding occurred in and around Rock Hall, Chestertown, Skinners Neck, Piney Neck and Cliffs City. Tidal flooding carried inland on the Chester River to Chestertown. Over 100 homes, vehicles and boats were damaged and/or ruined.

Isabel made landfall as a hurricane near Drum Inlet, North Carolina around 100 p.m. EDT on the 18th and weakened as it tracked farther inland. At one time in its life cycle, it was a powerful Category 5 hurricane when it was north of the Leewood Islands. Isabel's track took it west of Chesapeake Bay and was able to funnel water into the bay. This caused flooding along coastal areas all the way into New Castle County. Rivers and streams in New Castle County flooded from two fronts: from the heavy rain inland and also from the storm surge. The tide at Reedy Point reached 8.66 feet above mean lower low water at 506 a.m. EDT on the 19th. The surge was about 5 feet. The surge funneled up the bay and was lower and occurred earlier close to the coast. The highest tide at Lewes (Sussex County) was 6.51 feet above mean lower low water at 324 p.m. EDT on the 18th. The heavy rain did not coincide with the tidal flooding and occurred mainly from the afternoon of the 18th into the early morning of the 19th. Nevertheless, runoff from streams in New Castle County were slowed because of the incoming storm surge. While tides barely reached minor tidal levels along the ocean, the wave action on top of the tide caused beach erosion. Dunes were breached on the ocean front south of South Bethany and water overwashed onto Delaware State Route 1 in several locations. Winds gusted up to 70 mph and caused numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines to be knocked down. This was one of the worst power outage events in history for Conectiv Energy.  

The Christina River at Coochs Bridge (New Castle County) was above its 9 foot flood stage from 927 p.m. EDT on the 18th through 612 a.m. EDT on the 19th. It crested at 11.38 feet at 115 a.m. EDT on the 19th. The Red Clay Creek at Wooddale was above its 5.5 foot flood stage from 106 a.m. EDT through 728 a.m. EDT on the 19th. It crested at 5.87 feet at 430 a.m. EDT on the 19th. Peak wind gusts included 70 mph at the Pilot Tower (Sussex County), 62 mph in Lewes (Sussex County), 61 mph at the Dover Air Force Base (Kent County), 60 mph in Georgetown (Sussex County) and 53 mph at both Bear (New Castle County) and the New Castle County Airport. Storm totals included 1.88 inches in Greenwood (Sussex County), 1.74 inches in Georgetown (Sussex County), 1.46 inches at the New Castle County Airport, 1.35 inches in Milford (Kent County) and 1.00 at the Dover Air Force Base (Kent County).",312

At one time in its life cycle, it was a powerful Category 5 hurricane when it was north of the Leewood Islands. Winds gusted up to 60 mph in Eastern Pennsylvania and downed countless numbers of trees, tree limbs and power lines. It was the worst outage on record for PECO Energy in southeastern Pennsylvania. About 572,425 of its customers lost power. This exceeded the outages that occurred during the ice storm of January 1994. PECO Energy estimated it would cost at least $20 million dollars for it to install about 81 miles of new cable and install about 7,600 new fuses and circuit breakers. The large number of outages was not confined to the southeast part of the state. In Berks County, about 45,000 homes and business lost power. About sixty percent of Metropolitan Edison's 500,000 customers (including Berks County and the Lehigh Valley) lost power from 11,000 separate trouble spots. Pennsylvania Power and Light reported about 500,000 of its customers (including the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos) lost power. This broke their previous record during Tropical Storm Floyd by 150,000. Isabel's track took into western Pennsylvania and was able to funnel water into Delaware River and Bay. Moderate tidal flooding occurred. In Philadelphia, the tide crested at 9.47 feet above mean lower low water. The storm surge was 5.43 feet. The rain was not heavy and the only reported gaged stream flooding was in Chester County.  The heaviest rain with tropical systems often falls west of its storm track, thus the region was spared from the heavier rain.

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  

Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.

The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal.
 
No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.

Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. 

There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. 

The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.   Approximately 75% of the damage was estimated to be related to wind - $11.8 million.  Approximately 25% of the storm damage was estimated to be related to storm surge - $4.0 million.",420

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  

Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.

The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal.
 
No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.

Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. 

There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. 

The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.

Hurricane Ivan made landfall far enough to the east of the Mississippi Coast to minimize the damage to the coastal counties, however hurricane force winds did affect Jackson County. An anemometer on top of the Emergency Operation Center in downtown Pascagoula recorded a wind gust to 76 knots (88 mph) as the eye of the hurricane passed to the east of area. Tropical storm force winds occurred over Harrison and Hancock Counties with wind gusts approaching hurricane force in the coastal waters. A wind gust of 68 knots (78 mph) was recorded by an automated wind gage at Pointe Cadet in Biloxi Harbor, and 53 knot (61 mph) wind gust was recorded at the Emergency Operations Center in Waveland.

Jackson County experienced the greatest amount of damage among coastal counties. A roof was blown off of an apartment building in Pascagoula and at least a dozen homes suffered major damage either from wind or from fallen trees. Around 100 homes had some type of wind damage, along with 30 mobile homes and 25 businesses. Trees and large tree limbs were toppled in many areas contributing to power outages in Jackson County. Wind damage was much less over Harrison, Hancock, and Pearl River counties. There were scattered reports of fallen trees and tree limbs, downing power lines and causing damage to some houses. 

The lowest pressure recorded along the Mississippi Coast was 975.6 mb at 2336 CST on September 15th at the Pascagoula Airport. However power to the weather instrument failed shortly after this reading and a lower reading is highly likely. At Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, the lowest pressure of 982.9 mb occurred at 0055 CST September 16th. 

Storm surge was generally 3 to 5 feet above normal along the coast. The highest storm surge recorded was at the mouth of the Pascagoula River near Pascagoula with a storm surge 6.72 ft NGVD. Some tidal surge flooding occurred in low lying areas near the coast. 

No tornadoes were reported. Storm total rainfall varied from an inch or less in Hancock County to around 6 inches in eastern Jackson County. The highest rainfall total was 6.29 inches at the Pascagoula Emergency Operations Center.

Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.

Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.

Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer.

The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.

Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.

Based on observed damage, damages described by media and emergency management, and using a comparison of similar tropical storm events, total storm damage was estimated around 255 thousand dollars with approximately $50 thousand in damage from wind, $100 thousand in damage from storm surge, $100 thousand in damage from flooding as a result of heavy rain, and $5 thousand in damage from a brief tornado touchdown.",478

Zone 211: 
Nome: 45 Individuals temporarily evacuated in Nome during the height of the storm surge. 13 residences were affected by the storm. % residences were evacuated directly due to the coastal flooding. While the other residences, located near Front Street, were evacuated due to a combination of loss of electrical power and due to leakage of propane gas from three (3) businesses, as the valves broke on their 1000 pound propane tanks.  The storm surge cut the Nome-Council Road at Mile 22 resulting in the isolation of approximately ten (10) occupied residences in the Council area. In Nome, five homes reported minor damage and eight homes reported major damage. Multiple businesses in Nome also report damage.  The State building was damaged by ocean flooding.  The historic Cape Nome Road House, located at the site of Fort Davis on the Nome-Council Highway, sustained some storm-related damage. Power lines damaged at Nome.

Diomede: Power poles and lines damaged. Fuel line broken.  
Savoonga: Power poles and lines damaged.  
Brevig Mission: at a subsistence fish camp across the bay, a shack was damaged and several snowmobiles, parked on higher ground (not on the beach) were swamped with ocean water and covered with sand or small gravel, rendering them unusable. 
Wales: Wind blew off a portion of a roof from an Alaska Village Electric Corporation (AVEC) facility, as well as from a private residence.  A guardrail from another home was also lost. At the village clinic, the fuel line was ruptured when the metal support for the fuel line running from the tank to the building toppled over in the wind.  This spilled about 300 gallons of fuel.  One of the two wind generators of the village was damaged. Ocean water rose about 6 to 8 feet, and reached an outbuilding of the school, damaging the skirting along the bottom of the structure, but the structure otherwise was intact. Gravel and insulation over the school's septic tank and leach field damaged and removed by wave and wind action. Two snowmachines belonging to the school were damaged from the combined effects of water and wind-blown sand. Total School damages $8.4K. At the Water plant sewage leach field gravel and insulation was eroded away and septic tank possibly affected. At the Community Center sewage leach field, gravel and insulation was eroded away. Septic tank possibly affected. Road damage at the south end of the village.  There was soil erosion due to wind at the cemetery; Caskets are exposed. Wind damage to fence around the dump site by the airport.  
Teller:  At the School, the basement building was flooded, damaging materials stored there. Three Connex containers of new furniture were flooded, damaging the furniture.

The great deepening of the storm was due to in influx of moisture from an ex-typhoon east of Japan (though the ex-typhoon itself continued east across the north Pacific) and then the cold air around an upper level circulation of Far East Russia moving southeast into the low. On the 19th the storm began to slowly fill and decelerate, to 980 mb on the evening of the 20th 400 miles west of Kotzebue. The circulation around this storm covered western Alaska with 50 to 80 mph winds and was comparable or stronger than the November 1974 storm, though this current storm moved quicker over the Bering Sea and was located farther west than the 1974 storm. Nonetheless, a significant and damaging storm surge accompanied this storm in addition to high winds:
